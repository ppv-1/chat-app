### Chat-app 
Using websockets

Planned features:
1. User authentication: Add unique usernames for each client.
2. Message formatting: Display messages with usernames and timestamps.
3. Persistence: Store messages in a database (e.g., SQLite).
4. Front-end: Build a web-based front-end using something like React with a WebSocket connection to your Rust server.
